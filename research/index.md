## PhD Life &#127891;
Since August 2021 I am part of NTNU's [Industrial Ecology programme](https://www.ntnu.edu/indecol), a research group focusing on all things sustainability. I am extremely grateful for having gotten the chance to pursue my PhD here in this amazing environment with so many like-minded people. We are around 70 people, most of who are PhD students, and aside from research we sometimes also do some [fun stuff](https://www.instagram.com/p/CTmCOHDIRBa/). As mentioned elsewhere, my supervisors are Edgar and Richard, two icons of the field, from whose seemingly inexhaustible knowledge I hope to benefit greatly.

While still at the very start of my PhD experience, I already know a few bits and pieces of what I will be working on and with. Most importantly, I will use methods from the research fields of industrial ecology and socio-economic metabolism, first and foremost input-output analysis. And although it's been just a few weeks since I started, I feel like I have learnt so much already. How that looks like in everyday life I will document [here]({{ website_url }}/posts).

## Inspiration &#128218;
There is so much fascinating research out there and I would like to share here some of it. A few of my all-time favourite academic publications include:
- the [biodiversity threat hotspots paper](https://folk.ntnu.no/daniemor/pdf/MoranKanemoto2017_SpatialFootprintBiodiv.pdf) by my former master thesis supervisor [Dan Moran](https://folk.ntnu.no/daniemor/),
- the [2020-paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2189-9) by [Christopher Trisos](https://climaterisklab.com/team/) and colleagues on the projected timing of abrupt ecological disruption from climate change,
- and the [EXIOBASE](https://exiobase.eu/)-paper on the [global resource footprint of nations](https://www.academia.edu/download/35404560/creea%7B_%7Dbooklet%7B_%7Dweb%7B_%7Dspreads%7B_%7Dlowres%7B_%7D1.pdf).

## Teaching &#127890;
Since my PhD journey just started, I haven't been involved yet in any teaching. But I will be. Specifically, I will contribute to the graduate course on input-output analysis already next semester. I am quite looking forward to that, because I know from earlier that I really enjoy teaching classes.

During my time in Freiburg, I contributed substantially to the conceptualisation, realisation, and teaching of two master’s courses, namely one on material flow analysis and one on climate change mitigation and adaptation. In addition, I led a seminar and gave a few lectures in a third course on life cycle assessment.

Before that, while still a master's student at NTNU, I contributed as a teaching assistant in classes on life cycle assessment, life cycle impact assessment, and an introductory course on climate change.

## Selected presentations &#128172;
- *Of polar bears and plastic bags*\
    Workshop given at: Summer Campus 2019 at University of Freiburg

- *Identifying relevant impact pathways for marine invasive species within Life Cycle Assessment*\
    Poster presented at: NTNU Sustainability Science Conference 2017 in Trondheim
