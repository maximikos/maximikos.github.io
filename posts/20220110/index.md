Happy new year!

So, here we are, 2022! Time's passing sooo fast. While I've spent the last few months mainly reading loads of scientific articles and trying to test a few ideas, this year I have to get serious about it. After all, I'm just another employee with some deliverables. And those are not only set by my supervisors but also within the projects that I am participating in.

Since I'm a PhD STUDENT, I will also have to take some classes this year which I am very much looking forward to, particularly the ones on statistical learning and integrated assessment models. In addition, I will also be standing on the other side of the camera (or class room, depending on the corona measures...), as I will contribute to the teaching of the course on input-output analysis.

And then there are all these other things that need to be organised: snowboarding trips, the next Inde-Conversation, holidays at home, looking for a new place to stay etc.

2022 is not gonna be boring, it seems like.
