Here we are again - the year is soon coming to an end, many things happened, some good, some bad, and one gets again the feeling of not having done enough. Crazy how time flies!

Let me just list a few snapshots:
- doing my share of the teaching of the [input-output course](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TEP4222/2022/1#tab=omEmnet) in spring was fun but required quite some preparation. Understanding something for yourself and understanding it to a level that you can explain it to others are completely different. Certainly not a novel insight but one that kept me busy.
- taking classes myself filled up almost the rest of my schedule in spring. Perhaps a little overambitious, I had to drop one but was happy about my choice of learning more on statistical learning and integrated assessment models (and a little on atmospheric physics).
- after a long winter/spring (with many snowboarding trips), a rainy summer followed. Although I didn't have holidays (saving them for December!), I got to see the sun during an extended trip down to Portugal. I combined it with working from home and travelled by train and bus all the way from Trondheim to Munich, Paris, Alicante, Madrid, and finally to Aveiro, where I participated at a [conference](https://io9.shaio.es/en/).
- since then I have been very stressed out about writing a manuscript which is still waiting for completion...
- now winter is here, although there's no snow yet. And the most recent COP, [COP27](https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop27-key-outcomes-agreed-at-the-un-climate-talks-in-sharm-el-sheikh/), failed again to deliver!
- along the way, my partner and I decided to buy an apartment, I learned to love wood turning and ceramics, and I am very much looking forward to some quiet time ðŸ™‚
