After not being picked up by the taxi to reach the airport bus and now having to wait exactly there for my flight back home for Christmas, what better thing is there to do than to write on my birthday a little about the last few hectic weeks.

So, what happened in the last weeks?

Well, my research group was supposed to go on a a retreat in Oppdal (~2 hours south of Trondheim) where we wanted to go skiing and work a little on some scenario modelling. Because of the recent corona developments, however, we couldn't do that and had to stay at home. We still got our group experience, though, through working remotely on the scenario stuff. No play, all work...

But that was not too bad because we actually had some fun events in the week before. Namely, IndEcol's julebord (a Christmas party with colleagues) took place in an old restaurant on one of Trondheim's hills. We didn't come for the food though - if we did, we would have only gottten disappointed. After all, Norway is not known for being a place with culinary highlights, and in the festive season most dishes have some sort of meat as their main ingredient. Not the best match with our group where we have many vegans and vegetarians... But that didn't spoil the party!

After the julebord, the office got quite empty because many people left early for visiting their families at home. That's the time when you start to feel a little lonely in Trondheim. Note to self: Get away early as well!

Merry Christmas!
