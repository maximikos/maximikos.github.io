    I'm Max, and it seems like you want to get to know me a little more. In a nutshell, I'm a curious, outdoorsy person from Southern &#127465;&#127466;, now living in &#127475;&#127476; who loves to learn, experience, and travel. The long version of it is that I was born at 355 ppm about 30 years ago and was brought up in a tiny Bavarian village not too far from the border to Austria. Since then I've come around quite a bit, lived in multiple German towns and cities, had some stays in Oxford, Vienna, and Oslo, only to drive me up North, that is, Trondheim in Norway. There, I'm pursuing my PhD on global sustainability scenarios. Along the way, I try to document a little my PhD life and what my research is about.

## In the now
I am a PhD candidate at NTNU's [Industrial Ecology programme](https://www.ntnu.edu/indecol/) supervised by [Edgar Hertwich](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/edgar.hertwich) and [Richard Wood](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/richard.wood), two icons in the field of sustainability research. The broad theme for my research is to develop global pathways for how the UN Sustainable Development Goals can be reached, relying on environmentally-extended multi-regional input-output models. Wow, that's a mouthful! And that's of course way too broad of a description of what I am actually working on. If you are curious, have a read of [what my research really is about]({{ website_url }}/research).

## Earlier work
Prior to my PhD, I worked as Data & Verification Lead at [ClimatePoint](https://en.climatepoint.com/) in Oslo and was part of the [PROSET project](https://proset.inatech.de/) at the Albert Ludwig University in Freiburg, Germany. During my research role in Freiburg, I also had the chance to contribute to the teaching of classes on material flow analysis, lifecycle assessment, and a ring lecture on climate change mitigation. This latter ring series was a result of the efforts in the [Scientists for Future](https://www.s4f-freiburg.de/) group in Freiburg.

## Education
I hold an M.Sc. in Industrial Ecology (2018), from the very same programme where I am now employed, and a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering and Management (2015) from the Ilmenau University of Technology. During and between my studies I had the chance through multiple long-term internships and summer jobs to gain experiences in research, the automotive sector, and the aviation industry.

## Miscellaneous
I am interested in all things science and nature, love spending my spare time out in the mountains or by the sea, and am an avid advocate of the Oxford comma. If you want to see what my life outside academia (sometimes) looks like, follow along [here]({{ website_url }}/another_me).
