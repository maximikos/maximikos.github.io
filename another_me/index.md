# Life is not only about work &#127752;

... and my other me likes to travel, learn, and experience. Here are some impressions of how that looks like :)

Throughout the last years, I had the chance to see some beautiful places around the planet. My biggest adventure so far was a backpacking/hiking/hitchhiking trip trough the Caucasus, Central Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Although the travel bug has bitten me really hard, I can also be content when staying at places closer by. As mentioned elsewhere, I really love the outdoors and am most grounded when on a mountain or by the sea. Since I'm living in Trondheim, I don't have to go too far until I find what I'm looking for, that is, some nice hikes and snowboarding tours. It does, however, take a while to get to the nearest surf spot. And I haven't tried diving here yet. And kayaking neither. And so many other things. Time to get going :)
