# About this site

This is my personal academic website. All credits for the design of it go to  Jacob Vaverka, whose Julia-based [website](https://jvaverka.com/) I used as a template. I also took some inspiration from Max Koslowski ([website](https://maximikos.github.io/)), that in turn used the [website](https://fredrikekre.se/) of Fredrik Ekre as its inspiration.
